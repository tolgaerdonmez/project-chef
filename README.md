> An opinionated boilerplate creator cli for JavaScript/TypeScript applications using node.js

## Goal

It is always a hassle when starting a new project, getting the tsconfig, babel, etc...
Because of that I wanted a tool that is simple, yet powerful to initialize my fundamental setup.
Project Chef creates the fundamental setup for you, no need to surf through the net for the most basic babel config for es6 or trying to remember which flag adds typescript to my create-react-app project.

## Templates that I provide doesn't fullfil your needs

I'm working on for getting the latest templates from the [project-chef-templates](https://github.com/tolgaerdonmez/project-chef-templates) github repository automatically on every run, so that everyone can send a pull request and have their template in the cli.

I'm looking forward for your awesome templates !!!

More information about template structure is present in the templates repository page ---> [project-chef-templates](https://github.com/tolgaerdonmez/project-chef-templates)
